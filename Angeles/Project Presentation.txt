----------------- 1. The Scoping Phase

1.1 product need - problem or challenge being analyzed

1.2 initial solution ideation
- rough sketches of solutions
-- unsupervised clustering vs boosted-tree-based classification vs probabilistic inference
-- data to be used (external data source or monitored and saved data)
-- data exploration

1.3 Data Prep and accesibility
- dumping large data sets from production into their staging/exploration
counterparts -- needed for research phase to start

1.4 Scope & KPIs
"predicting Activity recognition accuracy will reach 90% or higher
after adding 10,000+ data points"


scope limitation 1: only using one ml model
scope limitation 2: 


1.5. Scope & KPIs approval

---------------- 2. The Research Phase
- data set has been acquired
- additional data sources may be added

Exploration vs. Exploitation:

Exploration - where we gather more information that 
might lead us to better decisions in the future

Exploitation: -where we make the best decision given current information


2.2. Literature & solutions review
- balance between exploration and exploitation, and between diving 
into the intricacies of the material and extracting takeaways 
and possible uses quickly

Conclusion

Now to bring this back to reality, and to connect our project to what our assignment was. 
The problem worth analyzing and visualizing was recognizing human activity data with
machine learning. We had a squeaky clean data set to work with, but we also wanted the 
challenge, we also aggregated our own data using our smartphones. Within a short time
(2 minutes) the smarphone has enough data to determine what its user is doing(95%: 6 activities).
By linking these insights of more personal data of the participants, extensivee options open
up. 

In addition, these insights have be extracted from using smartphone sensor applications
that can be found on Apple and Android app stores. 


What did we learn?

- our control group was not as controlled as it could have compared to the existing
dataset provided by a team that already conducted this project

- we learned how to keep data consistent
- we learned how to scale our model with 6 activities instead of working with than a 
  handful of activities
- we learned that we don't need to use everything we learned if it is not necessary
