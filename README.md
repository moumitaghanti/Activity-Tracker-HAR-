# Human-Activity-Recognization-HAR-
Load accelerometer data from the WISDM data set  and our data set

Convert and reformat accelerometer data into a time-sliced representation(so that they won't overlap)

Visualize the accelerometer data

Reshape the multi-dimensional features into two dimensional format

Split up the data set into training and test set

Flatten the  two dimensional format of the training data so that it is accepted by Keras

Defined and saved a deep neural network model in tensorflow Keras which can later be processed by other test data

Train the deep neural network for human activity recognition data (performance maximum upto 85%)

Validate the performance of the trained model against the test data using learning curve and confusion matrix(maximum upto 74%)
